# Project Abstract:

 This project presents an intelligent system for plant disease detection, whereby diseases are identified from images of the leaves of the plants with VGG16 as a pre-trained model in feature extraction and RandomForestClassifier for classification.

The workflow will involve training a machine learning model on the dataset of images of leaves, extracting meaningful features with the use of the VGG16 model, and classifying them through a Random Forest algorithm. Use the trained model for real-time prediction by testing it via a camera feed capturing images of leaves and processing them to detect disease.

This system has practical applications in agriculture, wherein the early and accurate identification of a plant disease can immensely improve crop managementâ€”thereby reducing losses. In this project, there is an integration of deep learning with the traditional machine learning algorithms to come up with a robust solution to the challenge of plant diseases detection.
